- default command **
- validations for default command **
- validations for command store **
- annotations for intellisense - comments on public members
- fix namespaces, probably just consolidate into a simple namespace for ease of use (public stuff only)
- parser: dump the "delete/remove type", dont allow changing of default enabled type predicates **
- post build callback **
- help feature
- optional validation/callback for sequence arguments
- complex scenario functional tests
- version feature


future roadmap
- callbacks on other configurable types, can specify timing relative to the stage processing
- callback argument for adding commands, that immediately fires upon processing of a command
- configurable exception handling strategy (and/or better handling?)
	- allow user to specify whether exceptions bubble or to capture and show help
- more configurable/optional hooks into various stages of the pipeline
