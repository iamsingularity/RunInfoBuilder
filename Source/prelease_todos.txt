- default command **
- validations for default command **
- validations for command store **
- annotations for intellisense - comments on public members
- fix namespaces, probably just consolidate into a simple namespace for ease of use (public stuff only)
- parser: dump the "delete/remove type", dont allow changing of default enabled type predicates **
- post build callback **
- help feature **
- optional validation/callback for sequence arguments
- complex scenario functional tests
- version feature **

-- check validations for subcommands, make sure at the same level, cant have same key
-- new "mutually exclusive set" argument? "SetArgument", 
	value must be one of configured: <value1|value2|value3> **
-- sequence arguments must be last??

- provide helper/derived of custom, like SingleArgument, RangeArgument(n), etc.. ??

-- check alll stage processing, ensure they're returning correct process results
-- test custom argument callback handling

future roadmap
- callbacks on other configurable types, can specify timing relative to the stage processing
- callback argument for adding commands, that immediately fires upon processing of a command
- configurable exception handling strategy (and/or better handling?)
	- allow user to specify whether exceptions bubble or to capture and show help
- more configurable/optional hooks into various stages of the pipeline
